1] use Strict =>
--------------
syntax =>

"use strict";

1. used to avoid potential bugs in the program.
2. makes our code more predictable.
3. gives error if we try to use any keyword which is reserved for future development. 
i.e. can be added to javascript later on.
4. also gives error if we use variables without declarations.

2] functions =>
---------------
1. "function" keyword is used to declare a new function.
2. function name is used along with parenthesis '()' in order to execute/call/run the code inside function.
3. function can accept any number of parameters/arguments to take input data to use inside function.
4. we can also use function without passing/having any parameters.
5. 'return' keyword is used to return the value from function to calling program.
i.e. to function call.
6. we can assign the value returned by a function to a variable.
7. we can call the function as many times as we want.
8. function may or may not have the return keyword.. i.e. function may or may not return value.
9. we use functions to write reusable code to avoid repetation of code.
10. function works on the principle of 'DRY' [DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF!]

FUN FACT : there are many functions that we use throughout our daily javascript programs.
for e.g.
	console.log();
	alert();
	document.write();
	prompt(); & many more..!
these all are javascript's inbuilt functions.
